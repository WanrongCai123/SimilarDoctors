Introduction: 

Used React to build a web application, when user select one of the doctors from the existing doctor, my application will search whole database to find some who has the same specialty with the selected doctor, order them by the review score.

 

Improvement: 

1. Because of some private policy, this time I only use the hard code data into the application. 

2. Add or delete the doctor

3. Update the location, avatar and score of the doctor

4. Add more information of doctor, such as hospital name, work phone number
